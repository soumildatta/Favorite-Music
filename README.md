# Soumil's Favorite Music ðŸŽµ
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/soumildatta/Favorite-Music/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)    
This is a simple web app created with ReactJS and Firebase to display some of my current and all time favorite songs.    
    
Those curious about my musical tastes can **search through the music** to see if I like a certain artist or song. The **song name can be clicked** to go to the YouTube link for the song. Users can also **leave a like on the songs**, which are updated realtime across all users in a twitter-like fashion.     
Hope you have a fun time exploring my musical taste and discover some cool new music for yourself!
